    "# 01. PyTorch Workflow Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "The essence of machine learning and deep learning is to take some data from the past, build an algorithm (like a neural network) to discover patterns in it and use the discoverd patterns to predict the future.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this module we're going to cover a standard PyTorch workflow (it can be chopped and changed as necessary but it covers the main outline of steps).\n",

    "| **1. Getting data ready** | Data can be almost anything but to get started we're going to create a simple straight line |\n",
    "| **2. Building a model** | Here we'll create a model to learn patterns in the data, we'll also choose a **loss function**, **optimizer** and build a **training loop**. | \n",
    "| **3. Fitting the model to data (training)** | We've got data and a model, now let's let the model (try to) find patterns in the (**training**) data. |\n",
    "| **4. Making predictions and evaluating a model (inference)** | Our model's found patterns in the data, let's compare its findings to the actual (**testing**) data. |\n",
    "| **5. Saving and loading a model** | You may want to use your model elsewhere, or come back to it later, here we'll cover that. |\n",
    "| **6. Putting it all together** | Let's take all of the above and combine it. |"
