# Pytorch Course

This is my version of the course [Learn PyTorch for Deep Learning: Zero to Mastery](https://www.learnpytorch.io)

This course will teach you the foundations of machine learning and deep learning with PyTorch (a machine learning framework written in Python).

## What you'll learn


| **Section** | **What does it cover?** | **Exercises & Extra-curriculum** | **Slides** |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| [00 - PyTorch Fundamentals](https://www.learnpytorch.io/00_pytorch_fundamentals/) | Many fundamental PyTorch operations used for deep learning and neural networks. | [Go to exercises & extra-curriculum](https://www.learnpytorch.io/00_pytorch_fundamentals/#exercises) | [Go to slides](https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/blob/main/slides/00_pytorch_and_deep_learning_fundamentals.pdf) |
| [01 - PyTorch Workflow](https://www.learnpytorch.io/01_pytorch_workflow/) | Provides an outline for approaching deep learning problems and building neural networks with PyTorch. | [Go to exercises & extra-curriculum](https://www.learnpytorch.io/01_pytorch_workflow/#exercises) | [Go to slides](https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/blob/main/slides/01_pytorch_workflow.pdf) |
| [02 - PyTorch Neural Network Classification](https://www.learnpytorch.io/02_pytorch_classification/) | Uses the PyTorch workflow from 01 to go through a neural network classification problem. | [Go to exercises & extra-curriculum](https://www.learnpytorch.io/02_pytorch_classification/#exercises) | [Go to slides](https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/blob/main/slides/02_pytorch_classification.pdf) |
| [03 - PyTorch Computer Vision](https://www.learnpytorch.io/03_pytorch_computer_vision/) | Let's see how PyTorch can be used for computer vision problems using the same workflow from 01 & 02. | [Go to exercises & extra-curriculum](https://www.learnpytorch.io/03_pytorch_computer_vision/#exercises) | [Go to slides](https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/blob/main/slides/03_pytorch_computer_vision.pdf) |
| [04 - PyTorch Custom Datasets](https://www.learnpytorch.io/04_pytorch_custom_datasets/) | How do you load a custom dataset into PyTorch? Also we'll be laying the foundations in this notebook for our modular code (covered in 05). | [Go to exercises & extra-curriculum](https://www.learnpytorch.io/04_pytorch_custom_datasets/#exercises) | [Go to slides](https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/blob/main/slides/04_pytorch_custom_datasets.pdf) |
| [05 - PyTorch Going Modular](https://www.learnpytorch.io/05_pytorch_going_modular/) | PyTorch is designed to be modular, let's turn what we've created into a series of Python scripts (this is how you'll often find PyTorch code in the wild). | [Go to exercises & extra-curriculum](https://www.learnpytorch.io/05_pytorch_going_modular/#exercises) | [Go to slides](https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/blob/main/slides/05_pytorch_going_modular.pdf) |
| [06 - PyTorch Transfer Learning](https://www.learnpytorch.io/06_pytorch_transfer_learning/) | Let's take a well performing pre-trained model and adjust it to one of our own problems. | [Go to exercises & extra-curriculum](https://www.learnpytorch.io/06_pytorch_transfer_learning/#exercises) | [Go to slides](https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/blob/main/slides/06_pytorch_transfer_learning.pdf) |
| [07 - Milestone Project 1: PyTorch Experiment Tracking](https://www.learnpytorch.io/07_pytorch_experiment_tracking/) | We've built a bunch of models... wouldn't it be good to track how they're all going? | [Go to exercises & extra-curriculum](https://www.learnpytorch.io/07_pytorch_experiment_tracking/#exercises) | [Go to slides](https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/blob/main/slides/07_pytorch_experiment_tracking.pdf) |
| [08 - Milestone Project 2: PyTorch Paper Replicating](https://www.learnpytorch.io/08_pytorch_paper_replicating/) | PyTorch is the most popular deep learning framework for machine learning research, let's see why by replicating a machine learning paper. | [Go to exercises & extra-curriculum](https://www.learnpytorch.io/08_pytorch_paper_replicating/#exercises) | [Go to slides](https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/blob/main/slides/08_pytorch_paper_replicating.pdf) |
| [09 - Milestone Project 3: Model Deployment](https://www.learnpytorch.io/09_pytorch_model_deployment/) | So we've built a working PyTorch model... how do we get it in the hands of others? Hint: deploy it to the internet. | [Go to exercises & extra-curriculum](https://www.learnpytorch.io/09_pytorch_model_deployment/#exercises) | [Go to slides](https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/blob/main/slides/09_pytorch_model_deployment.pdf) |
| [PyTorch Extra Resources](https://www.learnpytorch.io/pytorch_extra_resources/) | This course covers a large amount of PyTorch and deep learning but the field of machine learning is vast, inside here you'll find recommended books and resources for: PyTorch and deep learning, ML engineering, NLP (natural language processing), time series data, where to find datasets and more. | - | - |
| [PyTorch Cheatsheet](https://www.learnpytorch.io/pytorch_cheatsheet/) | A very quick overview of some of the main features of PyTorch plus links to various resources where more can be found in the course and in the PyTorch documentation. | - | - |
| [A Quick PyTorch 2.0 Tutorial](https://www.learnpytorch.io/pytorch_2_intro/) | A fasssssst introduction to PyTorch 2.0, what's new and how to get started along with resources to learn more. | - | - |
